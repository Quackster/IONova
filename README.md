# IONova

Based off the original ION/Deltar, this is designed to recreate the Habbo Hotel server using the beta flash client. The name, while inspired by ION/Deltar conveys the idea of using new and innovative libraries, upgrading the existing source code base that has been used. IONova is ION/Deltar, rewritten.

# Libraries

* Entity Framework Core (MySql)
* DotNetty

# Features

* SSO login
* Load friends list

(More will come later when I feel like it...)
